Note neither Integral or Linker official firmware update carries any Dolby Vision EDID tables as embedded and selectable from Custom EDID dropdown selector in GUI or APP/IR/buttons.
We have attached separately here some DV tables. The reason why Integral/Linker currently carries no DV tables is that for ex. Oppo forces DV always if it sees DV capabiliity in EDID. 
As very few people have DV displays it would be very bad to always get DV from oppo for any HDR.DV EDID have thus to be loaded manually for the moment (or DV forced via EDID flags in Automix Mode for Integral)

For true DV support, always use AUTOMIX on AVR-Key, Integral, Vertex.
Linker does NOT support all DV modes.
